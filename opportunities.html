                    <p>Intelligent control systems are all around us. From a car’s automatic braking system to the inner
                        workings of the human brain, control systems influence our lives everyday. We are the Systems
                        Controls Group at the University of Toronto, and we specialize in the analysis, design, and
                        control of intelligent systems, working on both theory and applications. We are looking for PhD
                        and Master’s students to join our respective research groups.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Mireille E. Broucke specializes in systems neuroscience, which is about the use of control
                        theory to understand the human brain.<a

                    <p>Prof. Luca Scardovi specializes in the analysis and control of interconnected systems with
                        applications to biology <a

                    </p>
                    <p>Prof. John Simpson-Porco focuses on robust optimal control with applications to energy systems

                    <p>If you are interested in undertaking a graduate degree in one of our research groups, we kindly
                        ask that you follow the instructions posted <a

                        interest area in your ECE
                        application. Applicants to the PhD program are expected to have prior research experience, and a
                        typical PhD applicant will have (or will be working toward) a research-based Master’s degree.
                        Note that the MASc and PhD degree programs are fully funded. We appreciate your consideration,
                        and we hope to see your application.</p>
